# Description

This project's goal is to learn to better code in C++

It goes over topics like cstrings, linked lists, templates, inheritance, polymorphism, algorithms and more.

It's split into 2 parts, small exercises and big exercises.

Small exercises are usually a lot easier and smaller to solve

Each exercise has a README.md file with a description of the task and a skeleton code to fill in.
Their solution is a single file, ending in Solution.cpp
